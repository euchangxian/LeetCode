## Description

Contains LeetCode Solutions written in different languages for ME to reference.

Started with Go, but Go as an interview language to solve LeetCode questions is
a poor choice, since Go's standard library is sorely lacking.
Also, solving string/char questions in Go was painful due to runes and such.
Though Go is still my favorite language by far for Software Engineering.

Tried Rust for the fun of it. Enjoyed it. Too difficult.

Now solving in C++. Like it.
